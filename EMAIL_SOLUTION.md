}
```

### 3. **Email Validation**

- ✅ Prevents sending to invalid email addresses
- ✅ Returns appropriate status for invalid emails

## 🚀 **Immediate Actions Required**

### Step 1: Fix Server Startup Issue

**Problem**: Express version 5.1.0 has breaking changes causing server startup failure.

**Solution**: Downgrade to Express 4.18.2

```bash
# In the backend directory, run:
npm install express@4.18.2
```

**Alternative**: If npm is blocked, manually update package.json:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Test Email with Real Customer Email

**Use the test script to verify email delivery**:

1. Edit `email-test.js` and change the customer email:
```javascript
const customerEmail = 'actual-customer-email@gmail.com'; // Replace with real customer email
```

2. Run the test:
```bash
node --experimental-modules email-test.js
```

3. Check the customer's email inbox and spam folder

### Step 3: Monitor Real Orders

When customers place orders, check:

1. **Server Logs** for email sending confirmation:
```
📧 Email sending process started...
📧 Customer email: customer@example.com
📧 Email configuration found, attempting to send...
✅ Email sent successfully to: customer@example.com
```

2. **Order Response** for email status:
```json
{
  "emailStatus": "sent",
  "emailMessage": "Invoice email sent successfully"
}
```

## 📧 **Email Delivery Checklist**

### For Each Customer Order:

1. **✅ Verify Email Format**
   - Customer email must be valid (contains @ and domain)
   - Invalid emails will show `emailStatus: "invalid_email"`

2. **✅ Check Server Logs**
   - Look for email sending confirmation messages
   - Check for any error messages

3. **✅ Check Customer Email**
   - Ask customer to check their inbox
   - Ask customer to check spam/junk folder
   - Verify the PDF attachment opens correctly

4. **✅ Test with Known Email**
   - Use your own email address for testing
   - Verify email delivery works

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting Steps**

### If Emails Are Not Being Delivered:

1. **Check Server Status**
   ```bash
   # Verify server is running
   netstat -an | findstr :5000
   ```

2. **Test Email Functionality**
   ```bash
   # Run standalone email test
   node --experimental-modules email-test.js
   ```

3. **Check Customer Email Address**
   - Verify customer entered correct email
   - Test with a different email address

4. **Check Spam Filters**
   - Ask customer to check spam/junk folder
   - Add sender email to contacts

5. **Check Gmail Limits**
   - Gmail has daily sending limits (500 emails/day)
   - Check if limits are exceeded

## 📋 **Testing Instructions**

### Test 1: Basic Email Functionality
```bash
node --experimental-modules email-test.js
```

### Test 2: Real Order Placement (After Server Fix)
1. Start the server: `node server.js`
2. Place a test order through the frontend
3. Check server logs for email confirmation
4. Check email inbox for invoice

### Test 3: Different Email Addresses
1. Test with Gmail addresses
2. Test with other email providers (Yahoo, Outlook, etc.)
3. Test with invalid email addresses

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

### ✅ **Success Indicators**
- Server starts without errors
- Order placement works correctly
- Email status shows "sent" in order response
- Customer receives email with PDF invoice
- Server logs show email confirmation

### ❌ **Failure Indicators**
- Server fails to start (Express version issue)
- Email status shows "failed" or "invalid_email"
- Customer doesn't receive email
- Server logs show email errors

## 📞 **Support Actions**

### If Issues Persist:

1. **Server Issues**
   - Fix Express version: `npm install express@4.18.2`
   - Check for other dependency conflicts
   - Verify all environment variables are set
